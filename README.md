# python-math-quiz
A simple Python program that tests your math skills in different number bases (e.g. base 10, octal, hex)

# Prerequisites
Python version 3+ or higher

This uses Python's PrettyTable to tabulate score, so you will need to make sure it is installed.
```bash
pip install PTable

# note if using Python 3 you might have to run it like so:
pip3 install PTable
```
